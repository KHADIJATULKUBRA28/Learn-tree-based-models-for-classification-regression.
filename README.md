Decision Trees & Random Forests – Task 5

This project demonstrates the use of Decision Tree and Random Forest models on a heart disease dataset using Scikit-learn.

Load and explore dataset
Train a Decision Tree Classifier
Visualize the decision tree
Train a Random Forest Classifier
Compare model accuracies
Show feature importances
Evaluate using cross-validation
Display confusion matrices

📂 Dataset

The file used is heart.csv, which contains patient health data and a binary target column indicating heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no).

📌 Models Used
Decision Tree
Simple, interpretable model but prone to overfitting.
Random Forest
Ensemble of multiple trees → higher accuracy and better generalization.

📊 Results Summary
Model	Accuracy (approx.)
Decision Tree	~75–82%
Random Forest	~85–92%
Random Forest performs better and is more stable across folds.
